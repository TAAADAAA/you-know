# You Know

## This is my practice repo:

  1. You can increment down in a readme file, aslong as the indents are correct.
  1. Here are a few tips to make your readme files standout. 
      1. links to reference site: [git](https://git-scm.com)
      1. links within the readme file: [included](#included)
      1. links within your repo: [start.txt](./start.txt)
  1. You can even create tables:
### Table of Columns: 
col 1 | col2  | col3
--- |--- |---
1 | 2 | 3
4 | 4 | 5

  1. You can also include inline code chunks by using the [backtick \`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent).
      1. an example of this would be: `git push -u origin master`. 
      1. another example is: `alias | grep 'git'`
  1. There are many other things you can do with a readme file, which you can find on the [adam-p's repo wiki page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
